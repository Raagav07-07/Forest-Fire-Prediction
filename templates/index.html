            <h2>About Forests and Forest Fires</h2>
            <p>
                Forests cover about 31% of the Earth's land and are crucial for biodiversity, climate regulation, and the water cycle. They provide habitats for countless species, help absorb carbon dioxide, and prevent soil erosion.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, forest fires—whether caused by lightning or human activities—can severely impact these vital ecosystems. While some species are adapted to recover quickly from fires, others face significant threats from habitat loss and soil degradation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Why Predicting Forest Fires Matters:</strong><br>
                - <strong>Early Detection:</strong> Helps minimize damage and losses.
            </p>
            <p>
                - <strong>Resource Management:</strong> Improves efficiency in firefighting efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                - <strong>Conservation:</strong> Aids in protecting and restoring ecosystems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our project uses advanced data analysis and machine learning to enhance fire prediction and mitigate impacts, safeguarding both the environment and biodiversity.

        <h2>Why FireWatch?</h2>
        <p>
            FireWatch is an advanced forest fire predicting model developed by Thiru Raagavendran S B, leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques to enhance fire management and prevention efforts. Central to FireWatch is the Support Vector Classifier algorithm, which is renowned for its exceptional performance in predictive analytics. This sophisticated model integrates critical parameters such as temperature, wind speed, fine fuel moisture, buildup index,fire weather index and initial surface ignition to deliver highly accurate and actionable predictions.

            SVC’s ability to handle complex datasets and uncover intricate patterns makes it an ideal choice for analyzing forest fire risks. Its scalability and efficiency ensure that FireWatch remains adaptable to evolving conditions and large volumes of data. By harnessing the power of SVC, FireWatch provides timely forecasts and invaluable insights, empowering decision-makers to proactively protect ecosystems and communities from the devastating impacts of forest fires.
